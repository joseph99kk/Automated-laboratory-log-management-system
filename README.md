Biomedical laboratories are sites of intense patient sample testing activity that leads to presenting of results to patients either directly or through clinicians in form of lab reports. Irrespective of the level of specialization of these sites, adherence to international standards
(ISO standard 15189:2022) that stipulate conditions for producing reliable test results and maintaining personnel safety is a condition for accreditation followed by annual audits so as to ascertain continued adherence. This involves monitoring ambient conditions in the lab, the
equipment that are used to transport, store and process samples for which all this information has to be consistently and periodically monitored by the lab personnel as guided by sections 6, 7 and 8 of the aforementioned standard. In light of the recent funding gaps experienced by the
healthcare system in the country, there is an emergent need to embrace automation of repetitive but important tasks, that are easy to forget by personnel due to smaller workforces at these sites and reduced morale in line with payment shortfalls, but very important for protecting the lab outputsâ€™ quality. A simple modular system that can collect this information would be of great use at these sites which could potentially send data (both ambient and machine generated) to lab record management systems as well as be used as a basis for troubleshooting anomalies automatically or sending alerts to concerned parties (biosafety officers) in case of major failures that require human intervention and can jeopardize result
accuracy and personnel safety. Additionary, for more sophisticated sites with dedicated HVAC systesm,additional control can be implemented so as to maintain proper working conditions as well. for this particular project,we sought to implement a negative pressure system as would be used in a biosafety level 3 and 4 laboratory
